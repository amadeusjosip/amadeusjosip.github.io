        <h3>Animation consists of two symbols. By default, these symbols are set to a question mark and an exclamation point. On the right side, there are settings that affect the animation itself, including two fields where other symbols can be entered so that the animation does not show the default symbols.</h3>
        <h3>Apart from modifying the symbols that are displayed, it is also possible to customize other aspects of the animation. Specifically, the background color, stroke, font size, and length of the trail that the letters leave. Those features enables users to have more precise control over how the animation looks.</h3>
        <h3>Finally, the animation can be saved by clicking the <span id="espan">SAVE as GIF</span> button. The animation is then saved as a GIF, and it loops perfectly.
